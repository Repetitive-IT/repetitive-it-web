In this Github Repo there is a little something which I use every time a  
customer has a need to scaling up and down a web cluster, but also wants  
the flexibility of having EIP addresses automatically assigned by the  
Auto-Scaling group.

Almost every time the reason for that is the whitelisting of the  
platform for transactions against payment systems but it could be  
everything reallyâ€¦

I hope it will be useful to someone out there
